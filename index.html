                <h2>Father of a Nation</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Rahman, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur</b> (1920-1975) Father of the nation and first president of Bangladesh (26 March
                    1971 to 11 January 1972). Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was born on 17 March 1920 in the village Tungipara under Gopalganj 
                    subdivision in the district of Faridpur. His father Sheikh Lutfar Rahman was a serestadar in the civil court of Gopalganj. 
                    Mujib, the third among six brothers and sisters, had his primary education in the local Gimadanga School. His early 
                    education suffered for about four years due to eye problems. He passed his Matriculation from Gopalganj Missionary 
                    School in 1942, Intermediate of Arts from Calcutta Islamia College in 1944 and BA from the same college in 1947.
                    Mujib showed the potential of leadership since his school life. While a student of Gopalganj Missionary School, AK 
                    Fazlul Huq, the then Chief Minister of Bengal, came to visit the school (1938). The young Mujib is said to have organized 
                    an agitation in order to impress the chief minister about the depressed situation of the region. While a student in Islamia
                    College he was elected general secretary of the College Students Union in 1946. He was an activist of the Bengal Provincial
                    Muslim League and a member of the All India Muslim League Council from 1943 onwards. In politics he had been a fervent follower
                    of hs suhrawardy.During the general elections of 1946, Sheikh Mujib was deputed by the Muslim League to work for the party 
                    candidates in the Faridpur district. After partition (1947), he got himself admitted into the University of Dhaka to study 
                    law but was unable to complete it, because he was expelled from the University in early 1949 on the charge of 'inciting the 
                    fourth-class employees' in their agitation against the University authority's indifference towards their legitimate demands.
                    In March 2022, Muktidata Sheikh Mujib (Liberator Sheikh Mujib), a memoir of Rahman, was published.
